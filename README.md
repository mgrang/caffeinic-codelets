## Coffee, Code, Repeat

Implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++.

### Usage
Initialize a new C++ program:
```
./init foobar.cpp
```

This will create foobar.cpp with the following skeleton code:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
}
```

Compile and run the program:
```
./bld foobar.cpp
```

This will invoke the system g++ compiler to build your program.
