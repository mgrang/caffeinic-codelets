Coffee, Code, Repeat

Implementations of some common algorithms and data structures in C++ (C++11
mostly).  I have used LLVM 5.0.1 compiler for X86 Ubuntu 14 to compile all the
programs. This can be easily downloaded from llvm.org's download page:

wget http://releases.llvm.org/5.0.1/clang+llvm-5.0.1-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04.tar.xz
